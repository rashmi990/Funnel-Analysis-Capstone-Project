# Funnel-Analysis-Capstone-Project
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the performance of Swiggy, one of India’s largest food e-commerce platforms, for the year 2019. The goal is to generate insights based on key metrics such as session details, traffic changes, conversion rates, and order fluctuations. Using data provided in the Funnel Case Study Data workbook, the project investigates various aspects of Swiggy’s business operations.

 Daily session counts and fluctuations in orders,Traffic changes from different channels,Conversion rates at different stages of the user funnel (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O),Identifying reasons for significant changes in performance.
### Files Included
This repository contains two primary files:

* **Funnel Analysis Report (Word Doc):** A detailed written report containing the business case insights, including:
Dates with order hikes and drops (compared to the same day last week)
Reasons for fluctuations in traffic and conversions
Hypotheses and validation for the changes in orders and conversions
Structured and formatted insights based on the data
* **Supporting Excel Workbook:** An Excel file containing all the necessary calculations, including:
Session details breakdown
Traffic analysis
Conversion metrics (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O)
Charts, tables, and conditional formatting to visualize insights

### Project Setup and Analysis Steps
* **Session Details Analysis**
The Session Details sheet provides data on daily sessions and transaction counts. The task is to:
Fill in the remaining columns based on the provided definitions.
Identify highs and lows in orders compared to the same day last week (consider a threshold of +20% and -20%).
Use conditional formatting to highlight significant fluctuations in orders.
Identify date of highs and lows for the orders compared to the same day last week.
Focus on weekends and exclude fluctuations within the ±20% range.

* **Traffic Analysis**
Use the Channel-wise traffic sheet to check for any significant changes in traffic compared to the same day last week.
Investigate the source of any traffic fluctuations by analyzing the traffic breakup across channels.

  * **Overall Conversion Analysis**
Break down the Overall Conversion into smaller conversion metrics:
L2M (Listing to Menu)
M2C (Menu to Cart)
C2P (Cart to Payment)
P2O (Payment to Order)
Identify fluctuations in conversion rates and pinpoint the stages where the most significant changes occurred.
Create hypotheses explaining these fluctuations and validate them using supporting data from the Supporting Data sheet.

### Key Analysis Steps:
* **Filling the Session Details Sheet**
Use the provided formulas to calculate each metric.
Ensure that the calculations are accurate and follow the definitions mentioned in the prompt.
Identifying Highs and Lows in Orders

* **Identify any order fluctuations above +20% or below -20% compared to the same day last week.**
Focus on weekends where spikes in orders are expected, but exclude insignificant changes.
Use Excel functions like percent change calculation to identify high and low days.

* **Traffic Change Analysis**
Check for changes in traffic on specific days using the Channel-wise traffic sheet.
Identify which channels experienced the most significant changes in traffic volume.
